We estimated that it would take only 5 hours for each person to finish cycle 3.

It is actually taking us about 9 hours to complete cycle 3.

move the way we wanted it to move and we underestimated how to kill the enemies and then make gold
coins appear after the gold bag has fallen more than 1 space.
